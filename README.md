# Personal-Tracking-App
A self-made personal tracking app to record my day to day data, intended to capture a years worth of data. Capable of recording my health, drinks, media, coffee, happiness and time statistics with the purpose of utlizing and improving on the statistical knowledge taught in University.

# Creation
Created with Google's dart language and Flutter's software development kit. Allows for the creation of applications for both IOS and Android, but as this application is intended for private use only, there is no use of the extension to IOS. A Firebase databse will be in the back end and used for the storage of the dataset, to be later analysed to answer multiple exploratory statistical questions on my day-to-day life.
